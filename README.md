I am currently a Masters in Business Analytics student. I have 11 years of professional experience in auditing, finance and investment related fields and I am looking forward to pursue a career related to financial investment analysis in the future.

Maria Navarro is my classmate, she is also a candidate of Masters in Business Analytics. She has a bachelor of science degree in Mathematical Economics from the University of Richmond in 2020. She loves to exercise and she goes to the gym every week for weight lifting and yoga. She is interested in environmental protection and sustainable energy and would like to continue her career in the field of environmental protection and new energy in the future.
